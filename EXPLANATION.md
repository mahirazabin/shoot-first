# Explanation

- The first complex part was figuring out how to position the players and obstactles and figure out which corner should my (0,0) position be, I chose bottom left corner since it was the most intuitive when understanding the position of the player and how the movement should be.

- The second complex part was figuring out how to dynamically add elements to the DOM and using callback functions to remove them once needed.

- The third complex part was figuring out the timing of the draw loop and how to manage all the elements on screen and differnt info for the players such as ammo, health, etc...
