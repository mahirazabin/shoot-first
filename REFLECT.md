# Reflection

- Learned how to dynamically add and remove elemnts from DOM
- Creating a game loop that runs consistently regardless of speed of processor (set to run on 60 fps)
- adding collision detection between elements
- adding event listners to control the game events
- having multiple views based on game state

The final product is almost as what I wanted when I started designing the game in Assignment 2, however due to time limitation I had to remove some of the features such as having a variety of different obstactle shapes and allowing them to stack, I also wanted to add the ability to shoot bullets at an angle however due to the same time constraints I had to reduce the scope of the shooting mechanic.

I did not decide to use AI since I wanted to gain a deep insight on how javascript is used to manipulate the DOM and I feel that AI will reduce my understanding as I would rely on it more rather than actually understanding the problem.
